**Validation: native speaker QA, annotation tools, field instruments, crowdsourced schema, cultural-linguistic QA loops.**

This repository is part of the **Integrative Linguistic Multiscript (ILM / علم)** initiative.

ILM / علم is a global effort toward phonetically accurate, reversible, culturally grounded transliteration across all scripts of the world. Programming tools, educational platforms, and cross-script AI reasoning benefit from this layered linguistic foundation — though the primary goal remains **linguistic and cultural equity** as humanity enters the singularity age.
